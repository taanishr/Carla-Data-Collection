# Carla-Data-Collection

## Known Issues
- Saving KITTI labels has not yet been implemented
- Occlusion has not been implemented into KITTI labels yet (view KITTI label format [here](https://github.com/bostondiditeam/kitti/blob/master/resources/devkit_object/readme.txt)

## TODOS (Not necessary)
- Implement script to make training, validation, and testing sets
- Adjust saving of files such that it follows the KITTI file structure as seen on this [page](https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_preparation.html#before-preparation)
