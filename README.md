# Carla-Data-Collection

## TODOS
- KITTI label creation needs to be tested
- Occlusion, truncation, and observation angle have not been implemented into KITTI labels yet (view KITTI label format [here](https://github.com/bostondiditeam/kitti/blob/master/resources/devkit_object/readme.txt)
- Implement script to make training, validation, and testing sets
- Create a more robust list of agents, so towns aren't just filled with cars
- Use other CARLA maps to create more varied data
