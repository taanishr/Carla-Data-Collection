    """ Saves lidar data to given filename, according to the lidar data format.
        bin is used for KITTI-data format, while .ply is the regular point cloud format
        In Unreal, the coordinate system of the engine is defined as, which is the same as the lidar points
        z
        ^   ^ x
        |  /
        | /
        |/____> y
        This is a left-handed coordinate system, with x being forward, y to the right and z up
        See also https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/498
        However, the lidar coordinate system from KITTI is defined as
              z
              ^   ^ x
              |  /
              | /
        y<____|/
        Which is a right handed coordinate sylstem
        Therefore, we need to flip the y axis of the lidar in order to get the correct lidar format for kitti.

        This corresponds to the following changes from Carla to Kitti
            Carla: X   Y   Z
            KITTI: X  -Y   Z
        NOTE: We do not flip the coordinate system when saving to .ply.
